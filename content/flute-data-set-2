            <p>For decades, identifying the regions of a bacterial chromosome that are necessary for viability has relied 
        		on mapping integration sites in libraries of random transposon mutants to find loci that are unable to 
        		sustain insertion. To date, these studies have analyzed subsaturated libraries, necessitating the 
        		application of statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a gap in transposon coverage is the 
        		result of biological selection and not the stochasticity of insertion. As a result, the essentiality of 
        		many genomic features, particularly small ones, could not be reliably assessed. We sought to overcome this 
        		limitation by creating a completely saturated transposon library in <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. In 
        		assessing the composition of this highly saturated library by deep sequencing, we discovered that a 
        		previously unknown sequence bias of the <em>Himar1</em> element rendered approximately 9% of potential TA 
        		dinucleotide insertion sites less permissible for insertion. We used a hidden Markov model of essentiality 
        		that accounted for this unanticipated bias, allowing us to confidently evaluate the essentiality of 
        		features that contained as few as 2 TA sites, including open reading frames (ORF), experimentally 
        		identified noncoding RNAs, methylation sites, and promoters. In addition, several essential regions 
        		that did not correspond to known features were identified, suggesting uncharacterized functions that 
        		are necessary for growth. This work provides an authoritative catalog of essential regions of the <em>M. 
        		tuberculosis</em> genome and a statistical framework for applying saturating mutagenesis to other bacteria.
