            <p>PATRIC provides two basic annotation sources, RefSeq, and PATRIC. RefSeq sequences from NCBI, have each
                been annotated by the submitting researcher using methodologies of their choice. PATRIC re-annotates all
                genomes using RAST tool kit <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4322359/" target="_blank">(RASTtk)</a>
                to provide annotation consistency across a wide variety of genomes. The original RefSeq annotations have
                been retained and are still available for comparison purposes.</p>
            <p>Genomes that are in more than 500 contigs are not annotated by RAST. Nor are plasmid-only genomes. There
                is approximately a two-month interval between when sequences are submitted to RefSeq and
                re-annotation/integration with PATRIC, thus there may be a significant difference in the number of
                genomes at NCBI and at PATRIC.</p>
