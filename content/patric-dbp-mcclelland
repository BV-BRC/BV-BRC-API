            <p>As part of our Driving Biological Project we have concentrated on a relatively underappreciated area of
                high-throughput genomics, comprehensive fitness assays. As our model we have used Non-typhoidal <em>Salmonellae
                    (NTS)</em>, which cause ~1.4 million cases of food-borne diarrheal disease annually in the United
                States, and hundreds of millions of cases worldwide, that are associated with hundreds of thousands of
                death. Despite the importance of this food borne pathogen and over 30 years of intensive study, much of
                the
                biology of <em>Salmonella</em> in the various niches in their complete life cycle is still poorly
                understood.</p>
            <p><b><i>The long-term goal of our work is to understand the molecular basis for the ability of NTS to
                survive
                outside hosts, to survive and persist in the intestinal tract of mammals and birds, and to cause
                systemic
                disease in some infected hosts.</i></b> As part of our DBP we developed new methods for high-throughput
                screening of mutants and, as a model, we developed a 300,000 transposon insertion library in Typhimurium
                and
                have screened it for fitness in over 300 in vitro conditions. This data is <a
                        href="http://brcdownloads.patricbrc.org/BRC_Mirrors/DBP/McClelland/">accessible here</a> along
                with
                the
                <a href="http://brcdownloads.patricbrc.org/BRC_Mirrors/DBP/McClelland/mcclelland_selection_metadata.xlsx">sample
                    metadata</a>. We paired this fitness data with RNA-seq data obtained in the same growth media, at
                log
                phase and stationary phase, for selected conditions. <a
                        href="http://rnaseq.pathogenportal.org/u/pathogen-portal/p/patric-example-data">This
                    data is used as an exemplar</a> for RNA Rocket, the Pathogen Portal expression data platform. The
                integration of fitness information with RNA-seq and other high-throughput data types has the potential
                to
                move forward the systems biology of organisms by, for example, identifying that subset of observations
                that
                are directly related to survival and those that are not.</p>
            <p>Using targeted deletion libraries that we developed in combination with unique microarrays (Porwollik et
                al.,
                2014; Santiviago et al., 2009b), we have also screened libraries of targeted single gene deletions (SGD)
                and
                multi-gene deletions (MGD) in multiple animal models including those for Salmonella bacteremia,
                Salmonella
                enteritis, and subclinical colonization by Salmonella (Elfenbein et al., 2013b; Porwollik et al., 2014;
                Santiviago et al., 2009b). Systemic illness and bacteremia can result from infection with NTS. Children
                under the age of five are most frequently infected with diarrheal NTS (20% of isolations in the United
                States in 2005) and along with the elderly and immuno-compromised are at high risk for the development
                of
                fatal systemic salmonellosis after NTS infection. We used our collection of targeted deletion strains in
                <i>Salmonella</i>
                serotype Typhimurium (STm) and a novel microarray to identify systemic colonization in <i>Salmonella</i>-susceptible
                mouse models (Santiviago et al., 2009b). In addition to the re-identification of known genes, we have
                also
                identified mutants in ~56 genes including six small RNA (sRNA) genes whose altered fitness during
                systemic
                infection is a novel finding. We have confirmed the phenotypes of 13 of the 19 mutants tested. These
                genes
                encode a supernumerary tRNA (leuX), three sRNAs (<i>sroA, istR</i>, and <i>oxyS</i>), 4 putative
                membrane
                proteins (<i>STM1131, STM2215, STM2303, STM2120</i>), 4 genes of unknown function (<i>STM3120, STM3121,
                    STM731, and STM1760</i>) and TatC (<i>STM3975</i>, a critical component of the twin arginine
                transport
                system for the transport of folded proteins across the inner membrane (Santiviago et al., 2009a). We
                have
                returned an intact copy of the appropriate gene to seven of these mutants, in <i>STM2215, STM2303</i>,
                <i>STM3120</i>,<i>
                    STM3121</i>, <i>STM3975</i>, <i>istR</i>, and leuX observed restored colonization of the spleen in
                all
                cases (Elfenbein et al., 2013b; Santiviago et al., 2009b) (Guo et al, unpublished results). We have
                further
                described the functions of two of these loci, one encoding the Twin Arginine Transport system (TAT)
                (Reynolds et al., 2011; Weatherspoon-Griffin et al., 2011), and the other encoding a phosphoidesterase
                of
                c-di-GMP (STM2215) &nbsp;(Zheng et al., 2013).</p>
            <p>We are also interested in how <i>Salmonellae</i> are able to initially colonize the intestinal tract, a
                niche
                where sv. Typhimurium induces a strong neutrophilic inflammatory response. In the face of this
                inflammatory
                response the numbers of serotype Typhimurium (STm) in the intestine increase sharply, while the
                intestinal
                microflora of the host are dramatically reduced. We have screened the same SGD library to identify the
                bacterial factors that allow STm colonize the intestinal tract, using the calf ligated ileal loop model
                of
                infection (Elfenbein et al., 2013a). We have identified a group of &gt;50 mutants that are selected
                against
                in this niche, over 30 of which are in genes not previously known to be needed during colonization of
                the
                intestine (Elfenbein et al., 2013a). We have further studied three genes that have emerged from this
                study,
                STM3846 encoding a putative reverse transcriptase (Elfenbein et al., 2013a), as well as a putative
                lipoprotein (Endicott-Yazdani, et al, in preparation) and a putative regulator (Elfenbein et al, in
                preparation).</p>
            <p>Very few genes have been previously identified that are necessary for colonization and persistence in the
                intestine in poultry. We developed a chick model for subclinical <i>Salmonella</i> colonization in my
                laboratory, and refined this model to hatch our own chicks, infect them at 4 days of age, and follow
                these
                infections over prolonged periods of time. We have screened our multi-gene deletion library in 4-day old
                chicks for mutants that are less fit in the intestine and in lymphoid tissue associated with the
                intestine
                to 12 days post inoculation, and a secondary screen of individual deletions identified mutants in 21
                genes
                as candidates under selection in the chick. Of these, we selected 9 for confirmation by competitive
                infection. We were able to confirm colonization defects during competitive infection for mutants in 6
                genes,
                and we all of these genes were linked directly to the observed phenotypes by complementation analysis
                (Yang
                et al, in preparation). In future studies we will work to identify the molecular role of these genes
                during
                infection.</p>
