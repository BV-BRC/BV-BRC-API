        <p>The regulation of host-pathogen interactions during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remains unresolved. 
        MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of the immune system, and so we used a systems biology approach to construct 
        an miRNA regulatory network activated in macrophages during Mtb infection. Our network comprises 77 putative miRNAs that 
        are associated with temporal gene expression signatures in macrophages early after Mtb infection. In this study, we 
        demonstrate a dual role for one of these regulators, miR-155. On the one hand, miR-155 maintains the survival of Mtb-infected 
        macrophages, thereby providing a niche favoring bacterial replication; on the other hand, miR-155 promotes the survival and 
        function of Mtb-specific T cells, enabling an effective adaptive immune response. MiR-155-induced cell survival is mediated 
        through the SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Thus, dual regulation of 
        the same cell survival pathway in innate and adaptive immune cells leads to vastly different outcomes with respect to 
        bacterial containment.

                    <td>	How the complex interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the host is regulated during 
                    infection is still not well understood. Using a systems biology approach, we demonstrate here that miR-155 
                    is one of several microRNAs that regulate host gene expression over the first 48 hours of Mtb infection in 
                    macrophages. miR-155 regulates the cell survival of Mtb-infected macrophages through SHIP1/AKT signaling. 
                    Using timecourse gene expression data, we constructed a miRNA regulatory network for the innate immune 
                    response to Mtb infection by WT macrophages. The network suggested a role for seven miRNAs in regulating 
                    the host response to Mtb, with miR-155 being one of them. We then validated a role for miR-155 by comparing 
                    the response between WT and miR-155-/- macrophages.
