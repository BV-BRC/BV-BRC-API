            <ul>
                <li>As a registered user, you will have access to various services such as Genome Assembly, Genome
                    Annotation, Variation, Expression Import, and Model Reconstruction.
                </li>
                <li>You can save sequences of interest you collect from PATRIC Searches and Tools into personalized
                    Groups within your Workspace. These Groups will then be easily available and accessible next time
                    you use any of PATRIC’s analysis tools. For more information on the Workspace and how you can
                    store/analyze data, see <a href="../../../../../workspace-faqs/">Workspace and Groups</a>.
