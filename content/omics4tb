            <p><strong>Project objectives:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> causes ~9 million new cases
                of active disease and 1.4 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease
                are universally outdated and overmatched. This project combines separate advances in systems biology and
                network modeling to produce an experimentally grounded and verifiable systems-level model of the MTB
                regulatory networks that affect disease progression. Our consortium of two projects and four Cores aim
                to reveal key features of TB disease progression in an iterative cycle: perturb carefully chosen
                subnetworks within both MTB and host; collect matched omics data sets; model, predict, and validate with
                new experiments.</p>

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">The DNA-binding network of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em></h4>
            <p>Publication: PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25581030">25581030</a> <em>Nat Commun,
                Volume 6, p.5829 (2015)</em></p>
            <p><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (MTB) infects 30% of all humans and kills someone every 20-30 s. Here
                we report genome-wide binding for ~80% of all predicted MTB transcription factors (TFs), and assayed
                global expression following induction of each TF. The MTB DNA-binding network consists of ~16,000
                binding events from 154 TFs. We identify &gt;50 TF-DNA consensus motifs and &gt;1,150 promoter-binding
                events directly associated with proximal gene regulation. An additional ~4,200 binding events are in
                promoter windows and represent strong candidates for direct transcriptional regulation under appropriate
                environmental conditions. However, we also identify &gt;10,000 ‘dormant’ DNA-binding events that cannot
                be linked directly with proximal transcriptional control, suggesting that widespread DNA binding may be
                a common feature that should be considered when developing global models of coordinated gene expression.

                factor overexpression-derived regulatory network.</h4>

            <p><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> senses and responds to the shifting and hostile landscape of the
                host. To characterize the underlying intertwined gene regulatory network governed by approximately 200
                transcription factors of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, we have assayed the global transcriptional
                consequences of overexpressing each transcription factor from an inducible promoter. We cloned and
                overexpressed 206 transcription factors in <em>M. tuberculosis</em> to identify the regulatory signature
                of each. We identified 9,335 regulatory consequences of overexpressing each of 183 transcription
                factors, providing evidence of regulation for 70% of the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> genome. These
                transcriptional signatures agree well with previously described <em>M. tuberculosis</em> regulons. The
                number of genes differentially regulated by transcription factor overexpression varied from hundreds of
                genes to none, with the majority of expression changes repressing basal transcription. Exploring the
                global transcriptional maps of transcription factor overexpressing (TFOE) strains, we predicted and
                validated the phenotype of a regulator that reduces susceptibility to a first line anti-tubercular drug,
                isoniazid. We also combined the TFOE data with an existing model of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> metabolism
                to predict the growth rates of individual TFOE strains with high fidelity. This work has led to a
                systems-level framework describing the transcriptome of a devastating bacterial pathogen, characterized
                the transcriptional influence of nearly all individual transcription factors in <em>M. tuberculosis</em>,
                and demonstrated the utility of this resource. These results will stimulate additional systems-level and
                hypothesis-driven efforts to understand <em>M. tuberculosis</em> adaptations that promote disease.</p>

                tuberculosis.</h4>

                <p>The resilience of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (MTB) is largely due to its ability to effectively
                counteract and even take advantage of the hostile environments of a host. In order to accelerate the
                discovery and characterization of these adaptive mechanisms, we have mined a compendium of 2325 publicly
                available transcriptome profiles of MTB to decipher a predictive, systems-scale gene regulatory network
                model. The resulting modular organization of 98% of all MTB genes within this regulatory network was
                rigorously tested using two independently generated datasets: a genome-wide map of 7248 DNA-binding
                locations for 143 transcription factors (TFs) and global transcriptional consequences of overexpressing
                206 TFs. This analysis has discovered specific TFs that mediate conditional co-regulation of genes
                within 240 modules across 14 distinct environmental contexts. In addition to recapitulating previously
                characterized regulons, we discovered 454 novel mechanisms for gene regulation during stress,
                cholesterol utilization and dormancy. Significantly, 183 of these mechanisms act uniquely under
                conditions experienced during the infection cycle to regulate diverse functions including 23 genes that
                are essential to host-pathogen interactions. These and other insights underscore the power of a
                rational, model-driven approach to unearth novel MTB biology that operates under some but not all phases
                of infection.</p>

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">A comprehensive map of genome-wide gene regulation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</h4>

            <p><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (MTB) is a pathogenic bacterium responsible for 12 million active
                cases of tuberculosis (TB) worldwide. The complexity and critical regulatory components of MTB
                pathogenicity are still poorly understood despite extensive research efforts. In this study, we
                constructed the first systems-scale map of transcription factor (TF) binding sites and their regulatory
                target proteins in MTB. We constructed FLAG-tagged overexpression constructs for 206 TFs in MTB, used
                ChIP-seq to identify genome-wide binding events and surveyed global transcriptomic changes for each
                overexpressed TF. Here we present data for the most comprehensive map of MTB gene regulation to date. We
                also define elaborate quality control measures, extensive filtering steps, and the gene-level overlap
                between ChIP-seq and microarray datasets. Further, we describe the use of TF overexpression datasets to
                validate a global gene regulatory network model of MTB and describe an online source to explore the
                datasets.</p>

             <h4 class="ribbon-title">Network analysis identifies Rv0324 and Rv0880 as regulators of bedaquiline tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</h4>
             <p>Publication: PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27573104">27573104</a> <em>Nat Microbiol. 2016 Jun 6;1(8):16078.</em></p>
             <p>The resilience of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) emerges from its ability to effectively counteract immunological, environmental 
                and antitubercular challenges. Here, we demonstrate that MTB can tolerate drug treatment by adopting a tolerant state that can 
                be deciphered through systems analysis of its transcriptional responses. Specifically, we demonstrate how treatment with the 
                antitubercular drug bedaquiline activates a regulatory network that coordinates multiple resistance mechanisms to push MTB into 
                a tolerant state. Disruption of this network, by knocking out its predicted transcription factors, Rv0324 and Rv0880, significantly 
                increased bedaquiline killing and enabled the discovery of a second drug, pretomanid, that potentiated killing by bedaquiline. 
                We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of this combination emerges, in part, through disruption of the tolerance network. 
                We discuss how this network strategy also predicts drug combinations with antagonistic interactions, potentially accelerating 
                the discovery of new effective combination drug regimens for tuberculosis.

             <h4 class="ribbon-title">MiR-155-regulated molecular network orchestrates cell fate in the innate and adaptive immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</h4>
             <p>Publication: PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27681624">27681624</a> <em>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Oct 11;113(41):E6172-E6181. Epub 2016 Sep 28.</em></p>
             <p>The regulation of host-pathogen interactions during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remains unresolved. 
                 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of the immune system, and so we used a systems biology approach to construct 
                an miRNA regulatory network activated in macrophages during Mtb infection. Our network comprises 77 putative miRNAs that 
                are associated with temporal gene expression signatures in macrophages early after Mtb infection. In this study, we demonstrate 
                a dual role for one of these regulators, miR-155. On the one hand, miR-155 maintains the survival of Mtb-infected macrophages, 
                thereby providing a niche favoring bacterial replication; on the other hand, miR-155 promotes the survival and function of 
                Mtb-specific T cells, enabling an effective adaptive immune response. MiR-155-induced cell survival is mediated through the 
                SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Thus, dual regulation of the same cell 
                survival pathway in innate and adaptive immune cells leads to vastly different outcomes with respect to bacterial containment.
