            <p>An advanced search, described below, may be conducted from the “Searches and Tools” tab at the top of the
                PATRIC site and from the “Search Tools” box on any Organism Landing page. To learn about Organism
                Landing pages, see the <a href="http://enews.patricbrc.org/patric-data-organization-overview/">PATRIC

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Protein Family Sorter Overview</h4>
            <p>The Protein Family Sorter tool enables researchers to examine the distribution of specific protein
                families, known as FIGfams, across different genomes.</p>

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">FIGfams</h4>
            <p>FIGfams are protein families generated by the Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes (FIG), which are
                based on a collection of functional subsystems, as well as correspondences between genes in closely
                related strains. FIGfams are sets of Protein Sequences that are similar along their full length.
                Further, all of the proteins within a single FIGfam are believed to implement the same function.
                Sometimes, we simply state that a FIGfam is a set of isofunctional homologs. Proteins are thought of as
                implementing one or more abstract Functional Roles. All of the members of a single FIGfam are believed
                to implement precisely this same set of functional roles.</p>

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Using the Protein Family Sorter</h4>
            <p>To begin, select your phylum, class, order, family, genus, species, or genomes of interest via the My
                Groups tab, the Taxonomy Tree tab, the Alphabetized Organism tab, or begin typing in the “Jump to”
                field. Then click on the View Protein Families button. Note: PATRIC can not filter searches yielding
                more than 400 genomes.</p>
            <p>You will be taken to an initial search results page, where results may be viewed via the default Protein
                Families (FIGfam) Table tab or the Heatmap Tab. For details on how to use the Heatmap Tab, please see <a
                        href="/content/Protein_Family_Heatmap">Protein Family Heatmap
                    FAQs</a>. Note: Larger searches may take PATRIC several minutes.</p>

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Table Filter Panel</h4>
            <p>Both the Table and Heatmap tabs may be filtered using this panel. The Genome Filter at the top of the
                panel allows for the following three filter selections to be made for each genome:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Selecting “Present in all Families” will show only protein families that include members from those
                    selected genomes.
                </li>
                <li>Selecting “Absent from all Families” will show only protein families that do not include members
                    from those selected genomes.
                </li>
                <li>Selecting “Either/Mixed” specifies that proteins from selected genomes may or may not be included in
                    the resulting protein family list. This option is set by default, and allows users to focus on only
                    those genomes they want to include and/or exclude without having to explicitly set one of these two
                    options for every genome.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Five Genome Metadata categories are also available to filter on (i.e. search for protein families that
                are present in genomes isolated from host A but absent in genomes from host B). The categories include
                country of isolation, host, disease, collection date, and completion date and are accessible by grabbing
                the right edge of the Filtering Panel and expanding it out.</p>
            <p>The Filters at the bottom of the panel enable narrowing of the results based on Keywords, Perfect
                Families, and/or the number of proteins or genomes per protein family.</p>

            <p>The protein sequences from each family were aligned using MUSCLE (v 3.6) and<br/>
                ambiguous portions of the alignment were removed using Gblocks (v 0.91b).</p>
