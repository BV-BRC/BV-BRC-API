    <h2>Omics4TB: Network analysis identifies Rv0324 and Rv0880 as regulators of bedaquiline tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</h2>

        <p>The resilience of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) emerges from its ability to effectively counteract immunological, 
        environmental and antitubercular challenges. Here, we demonstrate that MTB can tolerate drug treatment by adopting a 
        tolerant state that can be deciphered through systems analysis of its transcriptional responses. Specifically, we 
        demonstrate how treatment with the antitubercular drug bedaquiline activates a regulatory network that coordinates 
        multiple resistance mechanisms to push MTB into a tolerant state. Disruption of this network, by knocking out its 
        predicted transcription factors, Rv0324 and Rv0880, significantly increased bedaquiline killing and enabled the discovery 
        of a second drug, pretomanid, that potentiated killing by bedaquiline. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect of this 
        combination emerges, in part, through disruption of the tolerance network. We discuss how this network strategy also predicts 
        drug combinations with antagonistic interactions, potentially accelerating the discovery of new effective combination drug 
        regimens for tuberculosis.

                    RNA was isolated and applied to custom Agilent tiled arrays. Please note that experiments were performed 
                    technically as dual channel (eg, Cy3 and Cy5-labeled samples hybridized to the same array) but processed 
                    the results as though they are single channel (Cy3 and Cy5 signals are calculated). Therefore, there are 
                    two sample records per each raw data file and the raw data file associated with each sample is indicated 
                    in the corresponding sample description field.</td>
