		<p>PATRIC provides computed protein families at 3 levels: <a href="http://www.nmpdr.org/FIG/wiki/view.cgi/FIG/FigFam">FIGfams</a>, genus-specific protein families (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4744870/">PLfams</a>) and cross-genera protein families (PGfams). These protein families cover almost all of the proteins in the current public genomes (~100% protein coverage) to support more comprehensive comparative analysis.</p>
		<p>The protein families are computed using the procedure described below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All the proteins from public genomes currently available in PATRIC are assigned function based on the most recent signature k-mers. For all the proteins with identical functions, a similarity matrix is computed based on the number of signature k-mers they have in common, divided by average protein length for every pair of proteins. This k-mer similarity matrix is then processed using MCL algorithm, which forms one or more protein clusters based on similarity among the members.</li>
			<li>The genus-specific protein families are computed using only proteins within a genus and more stringent criteria (MCL inflation = 3.0). This provides higher sequence similarity and better specificity while performing within-genus/species or close strain comparisons.</li>
			<li>The cross-genera protein families are computed by clustering representative proteins from the genus-specific families with slightly relaxed criteria (MCL inflation = 1.1). This allows cross-genera or distant homologs to cluster together, which is necessary to support cross-genera comparative analysis across all microbial genomes.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The new protein families are accessible through the Genome and Gene Overview webpages and through the Protein Family Sorter tool. The Protein Family Sorter now allows users to perform comparative analysis using PLfams, PGfams, or FIGfams.</span></p>
