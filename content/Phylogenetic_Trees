            <h3 class="ribbon-title">Accessing Phylogenetic Trees on the PATRIC Website</h3>
            <p>Order-level Phylogenetic Trees can be accessed via the ““Phylogeny” tab on any PATRIC Organism landing
                page. You may also go access all Phylogenetic Trees in PATRIC by selecting “Phylogeny Viewer” from the
                “Searches and Tools” tab in the main navigation along the top of the PATRIC site.</p>


            <h3 class="ribbon-title">Tree Features and Functionality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There are three available coloring schemes for taxon labels to choose from in the menu located at
                    the top of the Tree:
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the “genus” color scheme any genera that occur more than once in the tree are assigned a
                            color and every taxon label within that genus is drawn in the genus color. There are a total
                            of 28 colors that may be used. If more than 28 genera are represented multiple times in the
                            tree then the most common genera will be assigned colors first. Colors are not re-used
                            therefore any additional taxa will be labeled in black.
                        </li>
                        <li>In the “species” color scheme each species within a given colored genus is assigned a
                            different color. The genus color is not repeated, so each taxon label will be a combination
                            of the genus color and a different species color. If a genus has more than 27 species then
                            the most common species will be assigned colors first. Colors are not re-used therefore any
                            additional species names will be labeled in black.
                        </li>
                        <li>The “off” color scheme shows all tree taxon labels in black.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The trees can be displayed in either phylogram or cladogram view. In phylogram view, the tree
                    branches are drawn with lengths based upon the branch lengths in the tree. In cladogram view, the
                    tree branch lengths are disregarded and branches are drawn so that all branch labels line up on the
                    right side of the display. Phylogram view conveys additional information about the evolutionary
                    divergence, while cladogram view allows better visual resolution of the branching pattern for very
                    closely related taxa (where the branch lengths are too small to allow the branching pattern to be
                    distinguished in phylogram view).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Display of branch support values can be turned on or off. When on, any branch support values below
                    100% are shown. Support values of 100% are not shown.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The taxon labels in the trees are the names of PATRIC genomes. Clicking on the name will take the
                    user to the coinciding Genome landing page.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Phylogenetic Trees may be downloaded as Newick files. Trees will also print as an image within the
                    page if the entire page is printed.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="ribbon-title">Phylogenetic Tree Construction</h3>
            <p>Trees are constructed by an automated pipeline that begins with amino acid sequence files for each
                genome. For each order-level tree the genomes from that order are used along with a small set of
                potential outgroup genomes. Sets of homologous proteins are identified in a two round processes. In the
                first round, a single genome from each distinct species is selected and these are searched against each
                other using <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQblat.html">BLAT</a>. The top scoring hits are
                clustered with <a href="http://www.micans.org/mcl/">MCL</a> and these clusters define the initial seed
                sets for the homology groups. In the second round, the seed sets are aligned using <a
                        href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/">MUSCLE</a> and HMMs are built with <a
                        href="http://www.csb.yale.edu/userguides/seq/hmmer/docs/node19.html">hmmbuild</a>. All genomes
                (including the outgroup pool) are searched with <a
                        href="http://www.csb.yale.edu/userguides/seq/hmmer/docs/node26.html">hmmsearch</a>. The top hits
                from hmmsearch are used to define the homology groups. Two outgroup genomes are selected from the pool
                of outgroup candidates based on total hmmsearch score.</p>
            <p>Homology groups are filtered for taxon coverage. Groups are aligned using MUSCLE. Poorly aligned, or
                noisy regions, are removed with <a
                        href="http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks.html">Gblocks</a>. Especially noisy or
                phylogenetically discordant homolgy groups are removed and the remaining groups are concatenated into a
                single long alignment. The main tree is estimated from the concatenated alignment with <a
                        href="http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/">FastTree</a>. Branch support values are not
                standard bootstrap values, which can be overly optimistic for very long alignments. Instead of
                bootstraps, trees are built from random samples of 50% of the homology groups used for the main tree, in
                a process referred to as gene-wise jackknifing. 100 of these 50% gene-wise jackknife trees are made
                using FastTree, and the support values shown indicate the number of times a particular branch was
                observed in the support trees.</p>
