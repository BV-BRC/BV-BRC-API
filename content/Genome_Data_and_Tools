            <p>The central data type in PATRIC is genomes. Most of the data and information within PATRIC is related
                back to sequenced, assembled, and annotated genomes stored in the PATRIC database. Genomes are
                incorporated from RefSeq, GenBank, and other sources, and are annotated using a standard annotation
                protocol, RASTtk, to enable comparative analyses and linking of data across the website.</p>
