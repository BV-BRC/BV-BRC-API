            <h4 class="far"><strong><em>Gene Page Transcriptomics Data Overview</em></strong></h4>
            <p>The Transcriptomics Tab at the gene-level summarizes the expression of a gene in all available
                experimental datasets. All the comparisons in which a gene is differentially expressed are listed in
                a table along with associated metadata such as Strain, Gene Modification, and Experimental
                Condition. Expression value based filters and a graphical summary of the experimental metadata allow
                you to quickly find top experimental conditions and gene manipulations related to the differential
                expression of the gene. This may help to confirm or infer potential function of the gene.</p>

            <p>Gene-level transcriptomics data is available under the Transcriptomics Tab on any given Gene Overview
                Landing page. You may search for your gene/CDS of interest using PATRIC’s Global Search and then go
                directly to the corresponding Gene Overview Landing page.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The data may be filtered, via the controls above the graphs, in the following ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use the keyword search box to find the comparisons with matching descriptions or
                            metadata. Some examples of keywords: “mutant”, “<em>rpoS”</em>, “temperature”, and
                            “oxygen”.
                        </li>
                        <li>Apply the |Log Ratio| and/or |Z-score| cut-off to see only those comparisons in which
                            the gene expression passes the cut-off. This, in addition to the graphical summary of
                            the metadata, allows for quickly locating experimental conditions that cause significant
                            differential expression of the gene.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reset the filters back to the default mode or click on Show All Comparisons to see all
                            the comparisons in which the gene is reported.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The Log Ratio and Z-score distribution graphs provide a quick visual summary of the number of
                    comparisons in which the gene is significantly expressed.
                </li>
                <li>The pie/bar graph of key metadata attributes, such as Strain, Gene Modification, and
                    Experimental Condition allows for quickly locating top gene modifications or experimental
                    conditions causing differential expression of the gene.
                </li>
                <li>The table below the graphs lists all comparisons matching the current filtering criteria. It
                    provides link-outs to corresponding NCBI publications (PubMed) and GEO experiment pages
                    (Accession). The table may be sorted based on any of the columns or downloaded as a text/Excel
                    file.

            <h4 class="far"><strong><em>Correlated Genes?</em></strong></h4>
            <p>For a gene of interest, the Correlated Genes tab shows a list of genes that have correlated
                expression profiles (positively or negatively) across all available data sets along with their
                functions. Thus, researchers may identify genes that are co-regulated or have similar functions. It
                can also help to infer potential function of a hypothetical or unknown gene.</p>
