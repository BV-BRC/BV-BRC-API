            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Accessing the Protein Family Heatmap on the PATRIC Website</h4>
            <p>This tool is accessible via the “Heatmap” Tab on the initial search results page generated within our
                Protein Family Sorter Tool. For information on how to use the Protein Family Sorter please see <a
                        href="/content/Protein_Family_Sorter">Protein Family Sorter FAQs</a>.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Protein Family Heatmap Overview</h4>
            <p>The Heatmap is an interactive visualization tool, which provides an overview of the distribution of
                proteins across a selected set of genomes. Patterns visible in a Heatmap can allow for many types of
                analysis such as, a bird’s-eye view of the conservation (or lack thereof) of particular genes of
                interest, discerning how many proteins have the same function within a single genome, and identifying
                proteins with multiple homologs or paralogs across a set of genomes.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Color Coding</h4>
            <p>Each cell is colored according to how many proteins from a specific genome are members of a given protein
                family. Black cells indicate that there are no representative proteins from a specific genome for that
                protein family. Bright yellow cells indicate there is one representative protein, dark yellow cells
                indicate there are two representative proteins, and dark orange cells indicate there are three or more
                representative proteins.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Table Filter Panel</h4>
            <p>Both the Table and Heatmap tabs may be filtered using this panel. The Genome Filter at the top of the
                panel allows for the following three filter selections to be made for each genome:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Selecting "resent in all Families" will show only protein families that include members from those
                    selected genomes.
                </li>
                <li>Selecting "Absent from all Families" will show only protein families that do not include members
                    from those selected genomes.
                </li>
                <li>Selecting “Either/Mixed” specifies that proteins from selected genomes may or may not be included in
                    the resulting protein family list. This option is set by default, and allows users to focus on only
                    those genomes they want to include and/or exclude without having to explicitly set one of these two
                    options for every genome.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Five Genome Metadata categories are also available to filter on (i.e. search for protein families that
                are present in genomes isolated from host A but absent in genomes from host B). The categories include
                country of isolation, host, disease, collection date, and completion date and are accessible by grabbing
                the right edge of the Filtering Panel and expanding it out.</p>
            <p>The Filters at the bottom of the panel enable narrowing of the results based on Keywords, Perfect
                Families, and/or the number of proteins or genomes per protein family.</p>
            <p>Note: PATRIC can not filter searches yielding more than 400 genomes.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Data Sorting</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The entire visualization may be sorted by choosing a reference genome to act as an anchor. This will
                    automatically sort all the protein families based on the gene order in that genome. To select a
                    reference genome, either chose one from the “Sort Protein Families by” field at the top of the
                    Heatmap or click on any genome in the Heatmap and then click the “Sort Protein Families” button in
                    the pop-up window.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">This functionality allows the user to quickly identify groups of contiguous
                genes present or absent in one or more of the selected genomes. In addition, the user can quickly
                visualize areas of loss or gain of genomic segments across genomes that are closely or more distantly
                related. Some of these areas may correspond to pathogenicity islands.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each individual column or row within the Heatmap may also be clicked and dragged to any specified
                    position.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Protein Family Heatmap Features and Functionality</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Genomes are listed along the Y (vertical) axis and corresponding protein families are listed along
                    the X (horizontal) axis. The scale of these rows and columns may be controlled by sliding the x
                    and/or y slidebars located at the axis intersection in the upper left corner of the Heatmap.
                </li>
                <li>Click on the Cluster button to show hierarchical clustering that allows for quick visual detection
                    of genes with similar expression patterns across one or more comparisons.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note: The default settings for the clustering button are based on the Pearson Correlation
                            Algorithm and a Pairwise Average-linkage Clustering Type. If you click on the Advanced
                            Clustering button, you may choose from several different distance measures and clustering
                            methods to be performed.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Use the Flip Axis button to arrange the Heatmap to better visualize your particular data set of
                    interest.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The following options may be accessed from a pop-up widow by clicking on any individual colored cell
                    within the Heatmap, any Genome label, or any Protein Family label. The same information can be
                    collected for a whole region of interest within the Heatmap by clicking and dragging to select a
                    group of cells.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The “Download Heatmap Data” button will show the count of representative proteins for each
                            genome in either a text or excel file. Note: Clicking this button from a Genome label will
                            produce a file with the count for each protein family within that genome, while clicking on
                            this button from a Protein Family label will produce a file with the count for that
                            particular protein family in every genome where it is found.
                        </li>
