Using a systems biology approach, we demonstrate here that miR-155 is one of several microRNAs that regulate host gene expression over the first 48 hours of Mtb infection in macrophages. miR-155 regulates the cell survival of Mtb-infected macrophages through SHIP1/AKT signaling. Using timecourse gene expression data, we constructed a miRNA regulatory network for the innate immune response to Mtb infection by WT macrophages. The network suggested a role for seven miRNAs in regulating the host response to Mtb, with miR-155 being one of them. We then validated a role for miR-155 by comparing the response between WT and miR-155-/- macrophages.","uri":"http://localhost:3001//view/ExperimentComparison/2000001","species":["Mus musculus"],"genomeVersion":["10090.24"],"validIdCount":2,"experimentSignificance":0,"significanceType":"TBD","idLists":[{"listIdentifier":"100000211","displayName":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 24 hrs vs 0 hrs","description":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 24 hrs vs 0 hrs","uri":"http://localhost:3001//view/ExperimentComparison/2000001#view_tab=comparisons","type":"gene","provenance":"Sissons JR, Rothchild AC, Aderem A from CIDR","significance":1050},{"listIdentifier":"100000212","displayName":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 4 hrs vs 0 hrs","description":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 4 hrs vs 0 hrs","uri":"http://localhost:3001//view/ExperimentComparison/2000001#view_tab=comparisons","type":"gene","provenance":"Sissons JR, Rothchild AC, Aderem A from CIDR","significance":1122},{"listIdentifier":"100000213","displayName":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 48 hrs vs 0 hrs","description":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 48 hrs vs 0 hrs","uri":"http://localhost:3001//view/ExperimentComparison/2000001#view_tab=comparisons","type":"gene","provenance":"Sissons JR, Rothchild AC, Aderem A from CIDR","significance":1161},{"listIdentifier":"100000214","displayName":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 8 hrs vs 0 hrs","description":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 8 hrs vs 0 hrs","uri":"http://localhost:3001//view/ExperimentComparison/2000001#view_tab=comparisons","type":"gene","provenance":"Sissons JR, Rothchild AC, Aderem A from CIDR","significance":1142}]},{"experimentIdentifier":"GSE79732","displayName":"Gene expression data from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected WT and miR-155-/- bone-marrow derived macrophages [validation]","type":"transcriptomics","description":"How the complex interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the host is regulated during infection is still not well understood.
