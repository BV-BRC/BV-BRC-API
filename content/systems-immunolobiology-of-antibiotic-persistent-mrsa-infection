            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
            <p>Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is a common and life-threatening bloodstream infection that is
                often caused by methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA). Of urgent concern, up to 30% of SAB patients fail
                antibiotic treatment even when gold-standard anti-MRSA therapy (vancomycin [VAN] or daptomycin (DAP]) is
                used. These patients have persistent bacteremia, which frequently results in a dismal clinical outcome.
                Even though the MRSA isolates from these patients appear to be “susceptible” to VAN or DAP based upon in
                vitro CLSI breakpoints, these antibiotics fail to clear the bloodstream infection. Such in vivo
                antibiotic resistance is termed Antibiotic-Persistent MRSA Bacteremia, or APMB. At present, there are
                few therapeutic options for these life-threatening infections. There is a critical, unmet need to
                understand the unique intersection of host and pathogen factors driving APMB. Elucidating these factors
                holds promise to lead to new approaches to prospectively identify patients at risk for developing APMB,
                and novel strategies to prevent or treat this often devastating infection. Importantly, APMB represents
                a unique subset of antibiotic resistant infections that differ from biofilm-associated infections due to
                “antibiotic-tolerant” or “recalcitrant / relapsing” isolates. APMB isolates are genetically stable, but
                highly adaptive strains induced by in vivo antibiotic exposure. Thus, mechanisms of persistent
                infections (APMB) are distinct from antibiotic-tolerant infections. Based on our extensive preliminary
                data, we hypothesize that APMB results from a three-way interaction among the pathogen, host immune
                response and antibiotic. We further posit that conventional approaches to study this clinically
                important phenomenon may be insufficient to understand it. Therefore, we will: 1) analyze the
                interactions of wild-type and mutant APMB strains with host cells and constituents in vitro, ex vivo,
                and in discriminative animal models to resolve key genotypic &amp; phenotypic determinants of the S.
                aureus persistome that drives APMB; 2) leverage our pioneering S. aureus Bacteremia Group (SABG)
                biorepository of human samples &amp; matched clinical isolates, genomic &amp; transcriptional analysis,
                and immunophenotyping to define host genetic and immune profiles of APMB during VAN or DAP treatment;
                and 3) use our powerful systems-based statistical and computational immunology approaches to integrate
                results of high-throughput genomics and transcriptomics data across studies to model the pathogen-host
                signatures unique to APMB. Therefore, we will resolve the pathogen and host factors that drive APMB to
                enable innovative approaches to predict, prevent and treat MRSA bloodstream infections that persist
                despite antibiotic treatment. These critically needed advances will derive from iterative refinement of
                studies that bring together proven strengths of an outstanding research team to apply an integrated,
                systems-based approach. The result will yield robust predictive algorithms for clinical evaluation for
                improved interventions against MRSA infections. Thus, through leading-edge methods and strategies that
                are optimized for synergy, our progressively focused studies in this U01 project are ideally responsive
                to the priorities of the NIH and this “Systems Biology of Antibacterial Resistance” RFA
                (RFA-AI-14-064).</p>
