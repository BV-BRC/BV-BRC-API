            <h4><b><i>Specialty Genes Overview</i></b></h4>
            <p>Specialty Genes refers to the special classes of genes that are of particular interest to infectious
                disease researchers, such as antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, drug targets, and human
                homologs.</p>
            <p>For each specialty genes class, PATRIC:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collects reference gene sets from popular and community recognized external databases, many of which
                    are manually curated based on literature.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Creates our own database of manually curated reference gene sets based on literature, as needed, to
                    provide more accurate and comprehensive information for NIAID select pathogens.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>As part of genome annotation, maps reference genes to their homologs based on high sequence
                    similarity using BLASTP, and thus, providing consistent annotation of specialty genes across all
                    bacterial genomes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Makes specialty genes accessible and usable by providing specialized analysis and search tools to
                    allow researchers to quickly select potential targets for the development of drugs, vaccines, and
                    therapeutics.

                <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Antibiotic Resistance Genes:</i> </span> Antibiotic
                    Resistance refers to the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics through gene
                    mutation or acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. We have integrated and mapped known
                    antibiotic resistance genes from the following sources:

                identified as playing a role in virulence in certain organisms. Each PATRIC_VF gene is linked to one or
                more journal articles that establish its virulence based on experimental evidence. For more details, see

            <h4><b><i>Mapping Specialty Genes to PATRIC Proteins</i></b></h4>
            <p>For each class of specialty genes, we gather reference gene sets from the data sources described above.
                We create specialized BLAST databases using protein sequences for each reference gene set, which are
                then used as part of the genome annotation pipeline. For each genome in PATRIC, we take all predicted
                protein sequences and search them against each of the specialized BLAST databases using BLASTP.</p>
            <p>The top BLAST hits are parsed and filtered based on sequence identity and sequence coverage using the
                following criteria:</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><em>(%Query coverage &gt;=80 OR %Subject coverage &gt;=80) AND %Identity &gt;=80</em>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">For identifying Human Homologs, we use:</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><em>(%Query coverage &gt;=50 OR %Subject Coverage &gt;=50) AND %Identity &gt;=50</em>
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <h4><b><i>Evidence Field</i></b></h4>
            <p>All the BLAST hits that pass the above-mentioned similarity criteria are further classified as follows
                using field “Evidence”.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Literature:</i> For any BLAST hit, if the query and the subject genes are the same, i.e. the same
                    genes in the same genome based on locus tag or some other identifier match, we designate the
                    Evidence as “Literature”. This means that there is direct literature evidence describing the gene in
                    question, which probably characterizes the gene based on experimental evidence.
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>*Note:</i> even when a hit is classified as “Literature”, sequence coverage and/or
                            percent identity for the sequence similarity could still be below 100%, because of the
                            differences in the start site of the same gene as predicted by different annotation systems.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><i>BLASTP:</i> For all BLAST hits that are not classified as “Literature”, we designate the Evidence
                    as “BLASTP”. This means that the gene in question is highly similar to a specialty gene described in
                    one of the source databases. However, the reference gene may or may not be exactly the same gene
                    and/or in the same genome.

            <ul>
                <li>Information about PATRIC genes, such as Genome Name, PATRIC and RefSeq Locus Tags, Gene Names, and
                    Products.
                </li>

                    Database Name, Source ID, Classification, and PubMed references. Source IDs are linked to the
                    corresponding pages on the Source Database websites where you can access more information. PubMed
                    links take you to the corresponding references lists at PubMed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Summaries of sequence similarity from BLASTP hit, such as Percent Query Coverage, Percent Subject
                    Coverage, and Percent Identity.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Specialty Gene List can be filtered using the progressive filters available in the left-hand panel as
                follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Filter by Keyword</i>: Search using any keywords related to the Organism Name, Gene Name, Locus
                    Tag, or Gene Product and find matching specialty genes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Filter by Property:</i> Select one or more classes of specialty genes, such as Antibiotic
                    Resistance Genes, or Virulence Factors.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Filter by Source:</i> Select one or more source databases to see genes similar to the reference
                    genes from those databases.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Filter by Evidence:</i> Hits designated as “Literature” imply that the query and the subject
                    genes are the same, i.e. the same genes in the same genome based on locus tag or some other
                    identifier match, however, there may be some differences in the start site. It means that there is
                    direct literature evidence describing the gene in question, which probably characterizes the gene
                    based on experimental evidence. All other hits designated as “BLASTP” imply that the gene in
                    question is highly similar to a reference gene described in one of the source databases. However,
                    the reference gene may or may not be exactly the same gene and/or in the same genome.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Filter BLAST Hits by Source Organism:</i> This allows researchers to find BLAST hits where the
                    query organism is the same as the source organism. The filter can be used to find hits from the same
                    genome, same species, or the same genus thus removing any hits based on other organisms.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Filter BLAST Hits by Sequence Similarity: </i> This allows researchers to filter hits by applying
                    different cut-offs for percent query coverage, percent subject coverage, and/or percent identity.
                </li>
