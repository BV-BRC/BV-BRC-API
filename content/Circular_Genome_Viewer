            <h3 class="ribbon-title">Accessing the Circular Genome Viewer on the PATRIC Website</h3>
            <p>Each Organism on PATRIC has an Organism Landing Page. To get to this page at the Genus level, select
                your Genera of interest from the Organisms tab on the PATRIC homepage. The phylogeny of each Landing
                Page is listed across the top of the page. Once on the Genera Landing Page, you may access the
                Circular Genome Viewer by drilling down in one of the following ways to either the Genome or the Feature
                level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select the Genomes tab, select your Genome of interest from the table, and click on the Genome icon from the green action bar. 
                	This will take you to the chosen Genome View Landing Page. Click on the Circular Viewer tab to access to the Tool.
                </li>
                <li>Select the Genomes tab, select your Genome of interest from the table. Press and hold on the Genome icon from the green action bar. 
                	This will provide you a drop down selections. Select the Circular Viewer from the list to access to the Tool.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Select the Features tab, select your Genome of interest from the table, and click on the Genome icon from the green action bar. 
                	This will take you to the chosen Genome View Landing Page. Click on the Circular Viewer tab to access to the Tool.
                </li>
                <li>Select the Features tab, select your Genome of interest from the table. Press and hold on the Genome icon from the green action bar. 
                	This will provide you a drop down selections. Select the Circular Viewer from the list to access to the Tool.
                </li>
