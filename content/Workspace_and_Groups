            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Workspace Overview</h4>
            <p>The PATRIC Workspace provides a private area in the website where you can run analysis services on your
                own data, store the results of those analyses, and create groups of data you have selected from within
                the PATRIC Website. In future releases, we plan to enable sharing of workspaces, comparisons of groups,
                and other functionality.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Accessing the Workspace</h4>
            <p>In order to use the PATRIC private Workspace, you must register and login. The registration link is
                at the top right corner of the PATRIC Website page. If you have already registered, you can login by
                clicking the &lt;Login&gt; button beside the registration link. Once you have logged in, you can
                access the Workspace by clicking the link beside the word WORKSPACE: in the top right of the PATRIC
                Website. The default workspace is called HOME.</p>


            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Creating and Using Workspace Groups</h4>
            <p>“Groups” in PATRIC are collections of items that you have selected and store together with a name that
                you provide. Groups are particularly useful for organizing and managing data sets of interest for
                further exploration and analysis.</p>
            <p>To create a Group, select the desired items from within any table in PATRIC and click on the Add
                Feature(s) button located in the Table Toolbar above the table. A pop-up window will appear where you
                may enter a group name and description for your selected items. You may also choose to create a new
                group or add items to an existing group.</p>


            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Using Your Workspace Groups in the PATRIC Website<strong></strong>
            </h4>
            <p>Many PATRIC features are available to work with data in your groups. This can be particularly useful if
                you have collected together a group of data items in PATRIC and wish to do further analysis with those
                items. For instance you may choose to analyze data your Workspace groups with PATRIC’s tools via the
                “Searches and Tools” tab at the top of the PATRIC site, and then select the group(s) you wish to include
                in the analysis.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Managing Your Groups and Data in the Workspace</h4>
            <p>The Workspace contains directory folders for organizing your data in the Workspace. An initial set of
                directory folders are provided as default locations for your data, based on data type. Clicking on one
                of the directory folder names selects it. The Information Panel on the right-hand side provides
                additional details about the selected item on the left-hand side.</p>
            <p>Double-clicking one of the directory folders displays its contents, for example, the genome groups you
                have created:</p>
            <p>Double-clicking one of the genome groups shows a listing of the genomes in that group. From here you can
                do several things such as download the data, delete items from the group, link to additional
                information, and other actions. To accomplish these various tasks, select the desired item(s) in the
                list and click the Action Buttons in the Action Bar on the right side of the page. You can select
                multiple items in the list by using the &lt;Shift&gt; or &lt;Ctrl&gt; (&lt;Cmd&gt; on Mac) keys while
                selecting items.</p>
            <p>To find out what each Action Button does, hover the mouse cursor over the icon to see a description. The
                specific Action Buttons that are displayed depend on the type of item that is selected and the available
                options for that item.</p>
