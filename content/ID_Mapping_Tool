            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Accessing the ID Mapping Tool on the PATRIC Website</h4>
            <p>This tool may be accessed from the MAP IDs Tools button in the light blue Table Toolbar at the top of
                PATRIC tables, including the Table Toolbar within your Workspace. It may also be accessed via the
                “Searches and Tools” tab at the top of the PATRIC site. To learn more about PATRIC Tables see <a
                        href="/content/Feature_Table">Feature Table FAQs</a>.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">ID Mapping Overview</h4>
            <p>The ID Mapping Tool allows users to quickly map PATRIC identifiers to those from other prominent external
                databases, such as GenBank, RefSeq, EMBL, UniProt, KEGG, etc. Alternatively, users can start with a list
                of external database identifiers and map them to the corresponding PATRIC features.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Using the ID Mapping Tool</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>To use the ID Mapping Tool from a Table Toolbar, simply select items in the table, click the <img

                    menu. Some example Use Cases include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Select a set of PATRIC features of interest from any PATRIC table and find corresponding
                            identifiers in one of the external databases, such as RefSeq locus tags, GI numbers,
                            UniProtKB Accessions etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>Select a set of PATRIC features of interest from any PATRIC table and find corresponding
                            metabolic pathways at KEGG or BioCyc.
                        </li>
                        <li>Select a set of PATRIC features of interest from any PATRIC table and find corresponding
                            protein structures in PDB.
                        </li>

            <ul>
                <li>To use the ID Mapping Tool from the “Searches and Tools” tab at the top of the PATRIC site, enter
                    your identifiers in the box to the left and select “From” and “To” ID types from the dropdown menus
                    on the right. Some example Use Cases include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with a set of external database identifiers, such as RefSeq locus tags, or UniprotKB
                            Accessions, and find corresponding features in PATRIC.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Note: You may enter your identifiers as either a list with one entry per line or
                                    multiple entries per line separated by commas.
                                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>First, PATRIC CDSs (protein coding genes) are mapped to corresponding CDSs in RefSeq/GenBank by
                    matching their stop position on genome sequences.
                </li>
                <li>Second, RefSeq/GenBank CDSs are mapped to corresponding UniProtKB Accession.</li>
                <li>Third, mappings are extended to other prominent external database identifiers using <a
