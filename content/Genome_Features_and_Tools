            <p>PATRIC genome features are the resulting annotations from the RASTtk system, and include coding sequences
                (CDS / gene calls), protein function predictions, rRNAs, tRNAs, and specialty gene designations. An
                array of various comparative tools are available in PATRIC for working with genome features and their
                products.</p>
