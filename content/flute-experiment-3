            <h3><strong>Comprehensive Essentiality Analysis of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Genome via Saturating Transposon Mutagenesis</strong></h3>
            <p>Publication:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241402/" title="PMC5241402">PMC5241402</a></p>
            <p>For decades, identifying the regions of a bacterial chromosome that are necessary for viability has relied 
        	on mapping integration sites in libraries of random transposon mutants to find loci that are unable to 
        	sustain insertion. To date, these studies have analyzed subsaturated libraries, necessitating the 
        	application of statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a gap in transposon coverage is the 
        	result of biological selection and not the stochasticity of insertion. As a result, the essentiality of 
        	many genomic features, particularly small ones, could not be reliably assessed. We sought to overcome this 
        	limitation by creating a completely saturated transposon library in <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. In 
        	assessing the composition of this highly saturated library by deep sequencing, we discovered that a 
        	previously unknown sequence bias of the <em>Himar1</em> element rendered approximately 9% of potential TA 
        	dinucleotide insertion sites less permissible for insertion. We used a hidden Markov model of essentiality 
        	that accounted for this unanticipated bias, allowing us to confidently evaluate the essentiality of 
        	features that contained as few as 2 TA sites, including open reading frames (ORF), experimentally 
        	identified noncoding RNAs, methylation sites, and promoters. In addition, several essential regions 
        	that did not correspond to known features were identified, suggesting uncharacterized functions that 
        	are necessary for growth. This work provides an authoritative catalog of essential regions of the <em>M. 
        	tuberculosis</em> genome and a statistical framework for applying saturating mutagenesis to other bacteria.
	     <p>The following file provides the insertion counts at TA sites (merged over 14 replicates) in .wig format 
		(the reference sequence for the coordinates was &nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/NC_000962.3" 
		title="NC_000962.3">NC_000962.3</a>).</p>

	      <p>The following Excel file provides a spreadsheet with essentiality calls for each ORF, performed using the HMM 
		 in Transit.  The categories are:
			<ul>
				<li>essential (ES)</li> 
				<li>essential domain (ESD)</li> 
				<li>growth defect (GD)</li> 
				<li>nonessential (NE)</li> 
				<li>growth advantage (GA)</li> 
				<li>uncertain (for short empty genes)</li> 
			</ul>
