            <p><strong>Project objectives:</strong> <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> is an emerging pathogen that causes
                primary and opportunistic infections, and is a serious concern in the hospital and battlefield settings.
                This organism has significant intrinsic resistance to antibiotics as well as an ability to quickly
                acquire new resistance. Additionally, <em>A. baumannii</em> can persist in a desiccated state on
                fomites, making disinfection and management of nosocomial infections particularly troublesome. The goal
                of the GUNK center is to find unexploited therapeutic approaches by elucidating the role of
                uncharacterized genes of <em>A. baumannii</em> in this organism’s mechanisms of pathogenesis,
                resistance, and persistence.</p>

            <p><em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen notorious for causing serious
                nosocomial infections that resist antibiotic therapy. Research to identify factors responsible for the
                pathogen’s success has been limited by the resources available for genome-scale experimental studies.
                This report describes the development of several such resources for <em>A. baumannii</em> strain AB5075,
                a recently characterized wound isolate that is multidrug resistant and displays robust virulence in
                animal models. We report the completion and annotation of the genome sequence, the construction of a
                comprehensive ordered transposon mutant library, the extension of high-coverage transposon mutant pool
                sequencing (Tn-seq) to the strain, and the identification of the genes essential for growth on
                nutrient-rich agar. These resources should facilitate large-scale genetic analysis of virulence,
                resistance, and other clinically relevant traits that make <em>A. baumannii</em> a formidable public
                health threat.</p>

            <p>Interspecies protein-protein interactions are essential mediators of infection. While bacterial proteins
                required for host cell invasion and infection can be identified through bacterial mutant library
                screens, information about host target proteins and interspecies complex structures has been more
                difficult to acquire. Using an unbiased chemical crosslinking/mass spectrometry approach, we identified
                interspecies protein-protein interactions in human lung epithelial cells infected with <em>Acinetobacter
                    baumannii</em>. These efforts resulted in identification of 3,076 crosslinked peptide pairs and 46
                interspecies protein-protein interactions. Most notably, the key <em>A.&nbsp;baumannii</em> virulence
                factor, OmpA, was identified as crosslinked to host proteins involved in desmosomes, specialized
                structures that mediate host cell-to-cell adhesion. Co-immunoprecipitation and transposon mutant
                experiments were used to verify these interactions and demonstrate relevance for host cell invasion and
                acute murine lung infection. These results shed new light on <em>A.&nbsp;baumannii</em>-host protein
                interactions and their structural features, and the presented approach is generally applicable to other
                systems.</p>

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Joint Transcriptional Control of Virulence and Resistance to Antibiotic and Environmental Stress
                in <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em></h4>
            <p>Publication: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4659468/"
            >PMC4532879</a>

            <p>The increasing emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens represents a serious risk to human
                health and the entire health care system. Many currently circulating strains of <em>Acinetobacter
                    baumannii</em> exhibit resistance to multiple antibiotics. A key limitation in combating <em>A.&nbsp;baumannii</em>
                is that our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of <em>A.&nbsp;baumannii</em>
                is lacking. To identify potential virulence determinants of a contemporary multidrug-resistant isolate
                of <em>A.&nbsp;baumannii</em>, we used transposon insertion sequencing (TnSeq) of strain AB5075. A
                collection of 250,000 <em>A.&nbsp;baumannii</em> transposon mutants was analyzed for growth within <em>Galleria
                    mellonella</em> larvae, an insect-based infection model. The screen identified 300 genes that were
                specifically required for survival and/or growth of <em>A.&nbsp;baumannii</em> inside <em>G.&nbsp;mellonella</em>
                larvae. These genes encompass both known, established virulence factors and several novel genes. Among
                these were more than 30 transcription factors required for growth in <em>G.&nbsp;mellonella</em>. A
                subset of the transcription factors was also found to be required for resistance to antibiotics and
                environmental stress. This work thus establishes a novel connection between virulence and resistance to
                both antibiotics and environmental stress in <em>A.&nbsp;baumannii</em>.</p>
