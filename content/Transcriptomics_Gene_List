                <h4 class="far"><strong><em>Transcriptomics Gene List Overview</em></strong></h4>
                <p>A Gene List in PATRIC is a custom user-created list of genes based on the transcriptomics datasets of
                    interest. Each Gene List displays all of the genes present in selected datasets, their functions,
                    and summaries of their expression levels in various samples or comparisons. A Gene List can be
                    dynamically filtered based on the identifiers/functions, expression levels, or up/down regulation in
                    one or more comparisons. Any subset of genes of interest can be downloaded along with the
                    annotations and expression values as tab-delimited text or Excel file; or saved as a Workspace group
                    for further analysis. A complementary Heatmap Viewer enables quick sorting or clustering of genes
                    and comparisons; and visualization of genes that are similarly expressed across one or more
                    comparison</p>

                <p>A Gene List may be accessed while under the Transcriptomics Tab (available on any Taxonomy or Genome
                    level landing page) in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select one or more Experiment(s) from either the Experiments Tab or the Comparisons Tab and then
                        utilize the Table Toolbar, located in the light blue row to:

                        List (Genes), list significant genes based on log ratio (|Log Ratio| &gt;= 1), or list
                        significant genes based on Z-score (|Z-score| &gt;=2).

                    one or more comparisons.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the Heatmap Toolbar located in the light blue row to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Flip Axes: By default, Comparisons are displayed along the X axis and Genes are

                                    <li>Red-Black-Green: Up regulated genes are red and down regulated genes are green.
                                        The brighter the color, the more differentially expressed a gene is. All the
