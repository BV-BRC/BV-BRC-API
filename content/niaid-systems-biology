        <p>The NIAID Systems Biology for Infectious Diseases Research Program develops and validates predictive models
            of infectious disease initiation, progression, and outcomes.&nbsp;These models are derived from the study of
            the architecture and dynamics of systems-wide host/pathogen molecular interaction networks during infection,
            using integrated datasets generated from a combination of “omics” technologies. The research findings will
            provide a deeper understanding of the overall complexity of the biological, biochemical, and biophysical
            molecular processes within microbial organisms as well as their interaction with the host.&nbsp;The programs
            provide data and reagents that result from the research conducted and provide training for the broader
            infectious disease scientific community to promote the use of the systems biology approach.</p>

        <h4 class="ribbon-title">&nbsp;Systems biology work specific to antibacterial resistance:</h4>
        <p>The following systems biology projects use a multi-disciplinary systems biology approach to study the
            molecular interaction networks of the pathogen and the host in association with antibacterial resistance or
            in response to treatment of antibacterial resistant infections.</p>
