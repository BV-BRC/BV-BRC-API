            <p><strong>Project objectives:</strong> <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> is one of the most successful
                pathogens in the world, still responsible for millions of deaths each year. Nearly half of its protein
                coding genes have functions that are unknown. FLUTE a Functional Genomics Resource Center funded by
                NIAID, with the goal of defining functions for unknown ORFs, hypothetical genes, and non-coding RNAs in

                Cholesterol Catabolism</strong></h3>
            <p>Publication:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3182942/"

            <p>The pathways that comprise cellular metabolism are highly interconnected, and alterations in individual
                enzymes can have far-reaching effects. As a result, global profiling methods that measure gene
                expression are of limited value in predicting how the loss of an individual function will affect the
                cell. In this work, we employed a new method of global phenotypic profiling to directly define the genes
                required for the growth of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. A combination of high-density
                mutagenesis and deep-sequencing was used to characterize the composition of complex mutant libraries
                exposed to different conditions. This allowed the unambiguous identification of the genes that are
                essential for Mtb to grow <em>in vitro</em>, and proved to be a significant improvement over previous
                approaches. To further explore functions that are required for persistence in the host, we defined the
                pathways necessary for the utilization of cholesterol, a critical carbon source during infection. Few of
                the genes we identified had previously been implicated in this adaptation by transcriptional profiling,
                and only a fraction were encoded in the chromosomal region known to encode sterol catabolic functions.
                These genes comprise an unexpectedly large percentage of those previously shown to be required for
                bacterial growth in mouse tissue. Thus, this single nutritional change accounts for a significant
                fraction of the adaption to the host. This work provides the most comprehensive genetic characterization
                of a sterol catabolic pathway to date, suggests putative roles for uncharacterized virulence genes, and
                precisely maps genes encoding potential drug targets.</p>

            <h3 class="ribbon-title"><strong>Comprehensive Essentiality Analysis of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Genome via Saturating Transposon Mutagenesis</strong></h3>
            <p>Publication:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5241402/" title="PMC5241402">PMC5241402</a></p>
            <p>For decades, identifying the regions of a bacterial chromosome that are necessary for viability has relied 
        	on mapping integration sites in libraries of random transposon mutants to find loci that are unable to 
        	sustain insertion. To date, these studies have analyzed subsaturated libraries, necessitating the 
        	application of statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a gap in transposon coverage is the 
        	result of biological selection and not the stochasticity of insertion. As a result, the essentiality of 
        	many genomic features, particularly small ones, could not be reliably assessed. We sought to overcome this 
        	limitation by creating a completely saturated transposon library in <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. In 
        	assessing the composition of this highly saturated library by deep sequencing, we discovered that a 
        	previously unknown sequence bias of the <em>Himar1</em> element rendered approximately 9% of potential TA 
        	dinucleotide insertion sites less permissible for insertion. We used a hidden Markov model of essentiality 
        	that accounted for this unanticipated bias, allowing us to confidently evaluate the essentiality of 
        	features that contained as few as 2 TA sites, including open reading frames (ORF), experimentally 
        	identified noncoding RNAs, methylation sites, and promoters. In addition, several essential regions 
        	that did not correspond to known features were identified, suggesting uncharacterized functions that 
        	are necessary for growth. This work provides an authoritative catalog of essential regions of the <em>M. 
        	tuberculosis</em> genome and a statistical framework for applying saturating mutagenesis to other bacteria.

            <h3 class="ribbon-title"><strong>Statistical analysis of genetic interactions in Tn-Seq data</strong></h3>
            <p>Publication:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334803"
                                    title="PMID 28334803">PMID 28334803</a></p>
            <p>Tn-Seq is an experimental method for probing the functions of genes through 
            construction of complex random transposon insertion libraries and 
            quantification of each mutant's abundance using next-generation sequencing. 
            An important emerging application of Tn-Seq is for identifying genetic 
            interactions, which involves comparing Tn mutant libraries generated in 
            different genetic backgrounds (e.g. wild-type strain versus knockout strain). 
            Several analytical methods have been proposed for analyzing Tn-Seq data to 
            identify genetic interactions, including estimating relative fitness ratios 
            and fitting a generalized linear model. However, these have limitations which 
            necessitate an improved approach. We present a hierarchical Bayesian method 
            for identifying genetic interactions through quantifying the statistical 
            significance of changes in enrichment. The analysis involves a four-way 
            comparison of insertion counts across datasets to identify transposon mutants 
            that differentially affect bacterial fitness depending on genetic background. 
            Our approach was applied to Tn-Seq libraries made in isogenic strains of 
            <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> lacking three different genes of unknown 
            function previously shown to be necessary for optimal fitness during infection. 
            By analyzing the libraries subjected to selection in mice, we were able to 
            distinguish several distinct classes of genetic interactions for each target 
            gene that shed light on their functions and roles during infection.</p>
