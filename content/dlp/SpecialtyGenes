				<div class='large'><p>Specialty Genes refers to genes that are of particular interest to infectious disease researchers, such as virulence factors, antibiotic resistance genes, drug targets, and human homologs. For each class, reference genes are collected from reputed external databases or manually curated by the PATRIC team and then mapped to their homologs based on sequence similarity using BLASTP. For more details, see <a href="http://enews.patricbrc.org/faqs/specialty-genes-faqs/" target="_blank">Specialty Genes FAQs</a>. We also provide a data summary targeted specifically to <a href="/view/DataType/AntibioticResistance">Antibiotic Resistance Data</a>.</p>

				<br/>
				<div class="data-box">
					<h4>Antibiotic Resistance:</h4>
					<p>Antibiotic Resistance refers to the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics through gene mutation 
					or acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. We have integrated and mapped known antibiotic resistance genes from the following sources:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://ardb.cbcb.umd.edu/" target="_blank">ARDB</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca/" target="_blank">CARD</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="data-box">
					<h4>Drug Targets:</h4>
					<p>Drug Targets refer to the proteins being targeted by known/approved/experimental small molecule drugs. 
					We have integrated and mapped such drug targets from the following sources:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://v3.drugbank.ca/" target="_blank">DrugBank</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/TTD/ttd.asp" target="_blank">TTD</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="data-box">
					<h4>Human Homologs:</h4>
					<p>Human Homologs refer to the bacterial proteins that share high sequence similarity with human proteins. 
					We have integrated and mapped proteins from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.26" target="_blank">Reference Human Genome at NCBI</a>.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="data-box">
					<h4>Virulence Factors:</h4>
					<p>Virulence factors refer to the gene products that enable bacteria to establish itself on or within a host organism 
					and enhance its potential to cause disease. We have integrated and mapped virulence factor genes from the following sources:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/SpecialtyGeneSource?source=PATRIC_VF&kw=" target="_blank">PATRIC_VF</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/" target="_blank">VFDB</a></li>
