            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Transcriptomics Experiment and Comparison Lists Overview</h4>
            <p>For any taxonomy level or genome, all publically available transcriptomics experiment datasets that are
                incorporated into PATRIC are displayed as Experiment and Comparison lists. The Experiment Tab shows a
                list of studies or datasets that contain one or more samples or experimental conditions. The Comparison
                Tab shows a list of curated pair-wise comparisons of two samples or experimental conditions to provide
                differential gene expression measurements. Metadata-based searching and progressive filtering allows you
                to quickly find datasets of interest.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Accessing Transcriptomics Experiment and Condition Lists</h4>
            <p>Experiment and Comparison lists can be accessed via the Transcriptomics tab on any Taxonomy or Genome
                level landing page.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Using Transcriptomics Experiment and Condition Lists</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All tables accessed via the Experiments and Comparisons Tabs may be sorted as described in <a
                        href="/content/Feature_Table">Feature Table FAQs</a>.
                </li>
                <li>Filter controls on the left allow you to filter the data based on the following key metadata
                    attributes (in orange text): Sample Organism, Strain, Gene modification, Experimental condition,
                    Time series, and Release date. To see all of the information associated with a specific attribute in
                    the list, click the “more” buttons, located within the list.
                </li>
                <li>From the Experiments tab, using links provided in a row, you can navigate to an individual
                    experiment landing page (Title), Gene List (Genes), publication page at NCBI PubMed (PubMed), or
                    detailed experiment page at NCBI’s GEO database (Link Out).
                </li>
                <li>From the Comparisons tab, using links provided in a row, you can navigate to corresponding Gene List
                    (Genes), list of significant genes based on log ratio (|Log Ratio| &gt;= 1), list of significant
                    genes based on Z-score (|Z-score| &gt;=2), publication page at NCBI PubMed (PubMed), or detailed
                    experiment page at NCBI GEO database (Link Out).
                </li>
                <li>From either tab, you can use the Table Toolbar, located in the light blue row to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Select one or more Experiments or Comparisons of interest and save them to your workspace as
                            a group by clicking the Add Experiments button. Creating a group from the Comparisons tab
                            will add the entire Experiment to your workspace.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Note: If you are a registered PATRIC user and logged in, your Experiment group(s)
                                    will be permanently saved to your workspace. To learn more about the benefits of
