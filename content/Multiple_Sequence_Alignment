                Website</em></strong></h4>
            <p>This tool may be accessed from the MSA Tools button in the light blue Table Toolbar at the top of PATRIC
                tables, including the Table Toolbar within your Workspace. From within the Protein Family Sorter you may
                chose to access MSA via the Table Toolbar or to conduct MSA for <strong>ALL</strong> protein members on
                any FIGfam details page by clicking “For All XX Members” link under “Integrated Protein Tree and
                Alignment<strong>” </strong>in the upper right corner of the page. For more details on the Protein
                Family Sorter please see <a href="../protein-family-sorter/">Protein Family Sorter FAQs</a>.</p>

            <h4 class="far"><strong><em>Multiple Sequence Alignment Viewer Overview</em></strong></h4>
            <p>The multiple sequence alignment viewer is an interactive tool that displays multiple sequence alignment
                and a family tree side-by-side and allows the user to examine details of selected protein families,
                including the overall quality of the alignment as well as more specific details such as particular
                regions or motifs of interest.</p>
            <hr/>
            <h4 class="far"><strong><em>Alignment Program and Source Data</em></strong></h4>
            <p>The protein sequences from each family are aligned using MUSCLE (v 3.6) and<br/>
                ambiguous portions of the alignment are removed using Gblocks (v 0.91b). The input data for the multiple
                sequence alignments are the protein sequences that have been grouped together in a FIGfam. When the user
                selects a FIGfam from the protein family sorter, all members of that FIGfam from the set of genomes
                being examined are included.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The Family Tree, displayed on the left side of the screen, may be collapsed or expanded in order to
                    co-locate sequences of interest.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>A scroll bar, located at the bottom of the alignment, allows for visualization of specific regions
                    throughout the amino acid sequences.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The Family Tree display can be switched between phylogram and cladogram views. In phylogram view,
                    the tree branches are drawn with lengths based upon the branch lengths in the tree. In cladogram
                    view, the tree branch lengths are disregarded and branches are drawn so all branch labels line up on
                    the right side of the Family Tree. Phylogram view conveys additional information about the
                    evolutionary divergence, while the cladogram view allows better visual resolution of the branching
                    pattern for very closely related taxa (where the branch lengths are too small to allow the branching
                    pattern to be distinguished in phylogram view). Cladogram view also shows branch support values,
                    which are calculated by <a href="http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/"
                                               onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/', 'FastTree. ');">FastTree. </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>You may chose to label the Family Tree with locus tags or genome names. In either view, you may
                    momentarily see both the locus tag and genome name identifiers by placing your mouse over a specific
                    branch label in the tree.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Within the alignment, columns highlighted in black are considered conserved. You may adjust the
                    conservation sensitivity with the slidebar located at the top of the alignment.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking within the alignment will highlight the selected amino acid column in blue and show the
                    numerical position designator for that column along the top of the alignment. It will also
                    automatically highlight the coinciding genome branches in the Family Tree with the same colors as
                    their respective amino acids in the alignment.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Both the alignment and the Family Tree are printable by clicking on “Printable Alignment” and
                    “Prinatble Tree” respectively at that top of the table. Note: The Family Tree may be printed in
                    either phylogram or cladogram view.
                </li>
