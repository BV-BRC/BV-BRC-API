            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Accessing the Comparative Pathway Heatmap on the PATRIC Website
            </h4>
            <p>This tool is accessible via the “Heatmap” Tab, which is accessed by clicking on any Pathway Name in the
                initial search results page generated within our Comparative pathway Tool. For information on how to use
                the Comparative pathway Tool please see <a href="/content/Comparative_Pathway">Comparative
                    Pathway Tool FAQs</a>.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Comparative Pathway Heatmap Overview</h4>
            <p>The Heatmap is an interactive visualization tool, which provides an overview of the distribution of
                genomes across the set of EC numbers within a selected pathway. Patterns visible in a Heatmap can allow
                for many types of analysis such as, a bird’s-eye view of the conservation (or lack thereof) of
                particular genes of interest, discerning how many proteins have the same function within a single
                genome, and identifying proteins with multiple homologs or paralogs across a set of genomes.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Color Coding</h4>
            <p>Each cell is colored according to how many proteins (features) from a specific genome are assigned a
                particular EC number. Black cells indicate that there are no representative proteins from a specific
                genome assigned that EC number. Bright yellow cells indicate there is one representative protein, dark
                yellow cells indicate there are two representative proteins, and dark orange cells indicate there are
                three or more representative proteins.</p>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Data Sorting</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The entire visualization may be filtered by annotation source. To do this, chose an annotation
                    source from the dropdown menu at the top of the Heatmap. Note: If you changed the annotation source
                    from the default source, PATRIC, on the KEGG Map tab, then your new selection will also be the
                    default when you click on the Heatmap tab.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Each individual column or row within the Heatmap may be clicked and dragged to any specified
                    position.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4  class="ribbon-title">Comparative Pathway Heatmap Features and Functionality</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>EC Numbers and Descriptions are listed along the Y (vertical) axis and corresponding Genomes are
                    listed along the X (horizontal) axis. The scale of these rows and columns may be controlled by
                    sliding the x and/or y slidebars located at the axis intersection in the upper left corner of the
                    Heatmap.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The following options may be accessed from a pop-up widow by clicking on any individual colored
                    cell, any EC label, or any Genome label within the Heatmap. The same information can be collected
                    for a whole region of interest within the Heatmap by clicking and dragging to select a group of
                    cells.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The “Download Heatmap Data” button will show the count of representative features from each
                            genome assigned to each EC Number in either a text or excel file. Note: Clicking this button
                            from a EC label will produce a file with the count for each genome assigned to that EC
                            number, while clicking on this button from a Genome label will produce a file with the count
                            for that particular genome in every EC number associated with your selected pathway.
                        </li>
