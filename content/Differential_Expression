            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Data Types Supported</h4>
            <p>In the PATRIC context, Differential Expression Data can include quantitative gene expression data
                generated by high-throughput technologies, such as microarrays or RNA-Seq, or protein expression data as
                well. PATRIC has integrated a large number of published gene expression datasets related to bacterial
                pathogens from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/"
                                  target="_blank">NCBI’s GEO database</a>.</p>

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Differential Expression Data on the PATRIC Website</h4>
            <p>You can access gene expression data at PATRIC in following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to any Taxonomy or Genome level landing page and click on the Transcriptomics Tab to see a list
                    of all experimental datasets available for that taxonomy level or genome.
                </li>
                <li>Go to any Gene or CDS level landing page and click on the Transcriptomics Tab to see all
                    transcriptomics datasets in which the gene is reported as being expressed. You can click on the
                    Correlated Genes Tab to see a list of all the genes that are positively or negatively correlated
                    with your selected gene.
                </li>
                <li>Transcriptomics data may be accessed via PATRIC&#8217;s Global Search.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Using Differential Expression Data at PATRIC</h4>
            <p>PATRIC provides a suite of integrated tools that allow you to explore, visualize, analyze, and compare
                published gene expression datasets available at PATRIC. You may also privately and securely upload and
                analyze your own unpublished gene expression data and compare it with other published datasets.</p>
            <p>Functionality includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>View lists of gene expression datasets available at PATRIC. Filter the list of Experiments or
                    Comparisons based on manually curated metadata (such as Organism, Strain, Gene Modification, and
                    Experimental Condition) to quickly find experiments of interest.
                    <ul>
                        <li>To learn how lists of experiments can be browsed, searched, and filtered, see <a

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Select one or more experiments and generate a dynamic Gene List and associated Heatmap viewer. You
                    can filter the Gene List based on Log Ratio or Z-score cut-off, up/down regulation, or gene
                    functions. Use the Heatmap Viewer and clustering to quickly find genes that are similarly expressed
                    across one or more comparisons. Your selections may also be saved as a group in your Workspace for
                    future use.

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Gene Expression Data Sources</h4>
            <p class="far">Most of the gene expression datasets available at PATRIC are published gene expression
                datasets related to bacterial pathogens from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/"
                                                                target="_blank">NCBI’s GEO database</a>.</p>
            <p>The following are the determining criteria for which datasets are currently incorporated into PATRIC:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Include only gene expression datasets. Exclude any datasets generated by genomic hybridization
                    assays, ChiP-chip/ChiP-seq, or protein arrays.
                </li>
                <li>Exclude any datasets generated using multi-organism platforms as it presents additional challenges
                    for data integration, presentation, and interpretation.
                </li>
                <li>Exclude any host response datasets, i.e., datasets measuring expression of the host genes.</li>
                <li>Exclude any datasets that are not published. Exceptions are made in some cases if the experimental
                    design is clear from the data or its description.
                </li>
                <li>Exclude any datasets (sub-series) that are part of a larger dataset (super-series) to avoid
                    redundancy. In such cases, only super-series are incorporated into PATRIC.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Gene Expression Data Curation and Processing Protocol</h4>
            <p>Once a dataset is retrieved from GEO, PATRIC performs the following steps to process it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Map organism and gene identifiers described in the platform to corresponding genomes and genes in
                    PATRIC.
                </li>
                <li>Manually review the experimental description and associated publication to understand the
                    experimental design and goals of the study.
                </li>
                <li>Decide which comparisons should be saved in the database. Carefully check for replicates and dye
                    swaps.
                </li>
                <li>Use a manual curation process to assure quality: create a comparison, combine results from
                    replicates (discard any replicates that are inconsistent), normalize and log-transform the data, if
                    required.
                </li>
                <li>Manually curate experiment and comparison metadata to accurately and consistently capture
                    information such as sample organism, strain, genetic modification, experimental condition, and
                    time-point.
                </li>
                <li>Lastly, integrate transcriptomics data with the genomic data in PATRIC to provide integrated data
                    analysis capabilities.
