            <h3 class="ribbon-title">Genome Metadata Overview</h3>
            <p>Genome Metadata is descriptive data about single genomes. Genome metadata on PATRIC consists of 61
                different metadata fields, called attributes, which are organized into the following seven broad
                categories: Organism Info, Isolate Info, Host Info, Sequence Info, Phenotype Info, Project Info, and
                Others.</p>

            <h3 class="ribbon-title">Metadata Attributes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Organism Info Attributes: Genome Info Id, Genome Name, NCBI Taxon Id, Genome Status, Organism Name,
                    Strain, Serovar, Biovar, Pathovar, Culture Collection, and Type Strain

            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Host Info Attributes: Host Name, Host Gender, Host Age, Host Health, Body Sample Site, and Body

            <ul>
                <li>Phenotype Info Attributes: Gram Stain, Cell Shape, Motility, Sporulation, Temperature Range, Optimal
                    Temperature, Salinity, Oxygen Requirement, Habitat, and Disease.
                </li>

            <h3 class="ribbon-title">Accessing Genome Metadata on the PATRIC Website</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Genome metadata can be accessed in multiple ways on the PATRIC website:</li>
                <li>You may view a metadata table, at any taxonomic level, via the Genome List tab on any Organism
                    Landing page.
                </li>
                <li>Selecting “Genome Metadata” from the “Searches and Tools” tab in the main navigation along the top
                    of the PATRIC site will take you to the Genome List tab for all available bacteria data on PATRIC.
                </li>
                <li>The Overview tab on each Organism Landing page (at any taxonomic level) provides a key metadata
                    attribute summary in the “Taxonomy Summary” table. Clicking on “View all genomes and summary terms”
                    at the bottom of this table will take you to the table provided under the Genome List tab.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note: The Taxonomy Summary table does not show all attributes or attribute data available,
                            however it shows the top 2 hits associated with each visible attribute.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Once you drill down to the Genome level within PATRIC, the Overview tab on each Genome Landing page
                    provides a key metadata attribute summary in the “Genome Summary” table. Clicking “more” at the
                    bottom of this table expands the table to show all available metadata for that particular genome.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3 class="ribbon-title">Genome Metadata Sources</h3>
            <p>PATRIC has collected metadata associated with bacterial genomes from multiple sources, such as NCBI’s
                BioProject database, GenBank records, and the Human Microbiome Project. Following the automated
                collection, the metadata was manually curated for consistency and accuracy, organized into a relational
                database, and integrated with the genomes available in PATRIC.</p>
            <p>PATRIC’s collection and refinement of genome metadata is an ongoing task. Future plans include
                integrating the genome metadata with various analysis tools available on the PATRIC website. If you have
                access to metadata that is not currently available on PATRIC, please contact us and we’ll be happy to
                update the site.</p>
