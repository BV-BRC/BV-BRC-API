[{"experimentIdentifier":"2000001","title":"Gene expression data from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected bone-marrow derived mouse macrophages [timecourse]","description":"How the complex interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the host is regulated during infection is still not well understood. Using a systems biology approach, we demonstrate here that miR-155 is one of several microRNAs that regulate host gene expression over the first 48 hours of Mtb infection in macrophages. miR-155 regulates the cell survival of Mtb-infected macrophages through SHIP1/AKT signaling. Using timecourse gene expression data, we constructed a miRNA regulatory network for the innate immune response to Mtb infection by WT macrophages. The network suggested a role for seven miRNAs in regulating the host response to Mtb, with miR-155 being one of them. We then validated a role for miR-155 by comparing the response between WT and miR-155-/- macrophages.","accession":"GSE79731","samples":[{"experimentIdentifier":2000001,"listIdentifier":"100000211","accession":"GSE79731","expname":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 24 hrs vs 0 hrs","genes":19734,"organism":"Mus musculus","sig_log_ratio":1605,"expmean":0.0030526617,"date_inserted":"2017-05-10T23:14:22.412Z","date_modified":"2017-05-10T23:14:22.412Z"},{"experimentIdentifier":2000001,"listIdentifier":"100000212","accession":"GSE79731","expname":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 4 hrs vs 0 hrs","genes":19734,"organism":"Mus musculus","sig_log_ratio":2774,"expmean":0.013806473,"date_inserted":"2017-05-10T23:14:22.412Z","date_modified":"2017-05-10T23:14:22.412Z"},{"experimentIdentifier":2000001,"listIdentifier":"100000213","accession":"GSE79731","expname":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 48 hrs vs 0 hrs","genes":19734,"organism":"Mus musculus","sig_log_ratio":1437,"expmean":-0.0064450633,"date_inserted":"2017-05-10T23:14:22.412Z","date_modified":"2017-05-10T23:14:22.412Z"},{"experimentIdentifier":2000001,"listIdentifier":"100000214","accession":"GSE79731","expname":"MTB infected mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages, 8 hrs vs 0 hrs","genes":19734,"organism":"Mus musculus","sig_log_ratio":2979,"expmean":0.008426608,"date_inserted":"2017-05-10T23:14:22.412Z","date_modified":"2017-05-10T23:14:22.412Z"}],"genes":19734,"genome_ids":["10090.24"],"organism":["Mus musculus"],"pmid":"27681624","date_inserted":"2017-05-10T23:13:54.890Z","date_modified":"2017-05-10T23:13:54.890Z","institution":"CIDR","author":"Sissons JR, Rothchild AC, Aderem A","condition":["infection","host response"]}]
