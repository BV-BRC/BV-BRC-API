            <p><strong>Host-Microbe Protein Interactions during Bacterial Infection</strong></p>

            <p>Interspecies protein-protein interactions are essential mediators of infection. While bacterial proteins
                required for host cell invasion and infection can be identified through bacterial mutant library
                screens, information about host target proteins and interspecies complex structures has been more
                difficult to acquire. Using an unbiased chemical crosslinking/mass spectrometry approach, we identified
                interspecies protein-protein interactions in human lung epithelial cells infected with <em>Acinetobacter
                    baumannii</em>. These efforts resulted in identification of 3,076 crosslinked peptide pairs and 46
                interspecies protein-protein interactions. Most notably, the key <em>A.&nbsp;baumannii</em> virulence
                factor, OmpA, was identified as crosslinked to host proteins involved in desmosomes, specialized
                structures that mediate host cell-to-cell adhesion. Co-immunoprecipitation and transposon mutant
                experiments were used to verify these interactions and demonstrate relevance for host cell invasion and
                acute murine lung infection. These results shed new light on <em>A.&nbsp;baumannii</em>-host protein
                interactions and their structural features, and the presented approach is generally applicable to other
                systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Protein-Protein Interaction Datasets:</strong></p>
            <p><em>In&nbsp;vivo</em> proteomic XL-MS analysis of proteins from infected H292 lung epithelial cells
                generated 16,758 crosslinked peptide-peptide relationships. Of these, we identified 3,076 non-redundant
                peptide-peptide relationships across three biological replicates at a relationship false discovery rate
                (FDR) of 0.24%. Crosslinked peptide-peptide relationships were mapped to a network of 715
                protein-protein interactions (PPIs) attributed to 488 human proteins and 113 bacterial proteins.</p>

            <p>In addition to crosslinking infected host cells, we harvested AB5075 alone and crosslinked the bacterial
                cells to improve network and structural coverage of bacterial interprotein and intraprotein crosslinks
                within AB5075.</p>
