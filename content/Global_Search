            <p>PATRIC provides a global search capability to quickly locate data of interest.  The Search box is 
               available on the right side of the menu bar at the top of each PATRIC page. Features of the Global 
               Search include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Top matches, sorted by data types, including genomes, genomic features, taxa, specialty genes, 
                    and transcriptomics experiments. Clicking on the number beside the data type section headers returns 
                    all matching data for that type.</li>
                <li>Data type specific searches. Pre-filter results to specific data types by clicking the down arrow 
                    on the left side of the search box.</li>
                <li>Add additional search conditions using keywords AND, OR, and parentheses '( )'. Note that 
                    multiple search terms are 'AND'ed together by default (each term must be in the item for 
                    it to have a match). Return only exact matches to the search term by enclosing it in quotes</li>
                <li>Search a specific data field for a particular value by using field:value in the search box.  For 
                    example, entering genome_id:123434.3 will search only the genome_id field in the database for the
                    term "123434.3"
            </ul>
