            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Comparative Pathway Tool Overview</h4>
            <p>The Comparative Pathway Tool allows you to identify a set of pathways based on taxonomy, EC number,
                pathway ID, pathway name and/or specific annotation type. The Comparative Pathway Tool displays a table
                of unique pathways that match the search criteria. From there, you can select specific pathways of
                interest and view the Comparative Pathway KEGG Map and the Comparative Pathway Heatmap.</p>

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Using the Comparative Pathway Tool</h4>
            <p>To begin, conduct an initial search by 1) selecting your phylum, class, order, family, genus, species, or
                genomes of interest via the Taxonomy Tree tab, the Alphabetized Organism tab, or begin typing in the
                “Jump to” field 2) utilizing the Keyword search functionality, or 3) a combination of both. Then click
                on the Search button. Note: Larger searches may take PATRIC several minutes. For an explanation of
                various annotation sources, please see <a href="/content/Genome_Annotations">Annotation FAQs.</a>
            </p>
            <p>Results will be shown in a Pathway table. From here you may do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the three tabs (Pathways, EC number, and Genes) at the top of the table to navigate your search
                    results. Click on links within rows under each tab to navigate to the various pages:
                    <ul>
                        <li>From the Pathway tab you can navigate within rows to a specific PATRIC Pathway Map page
                            (Pathway Name), a table with all the EC numbers annotated in a particular pathway (Unique EC
                            Count), and a table with all the genes in a particular pathway (Unique Gene Count).
                        </li>
                        <li>From the EC Number tab you can navigate within rows to a specific PATRIC Pathway Map page
                            (Pathway Name), a table with all the genes for a particular EC number (Unique Gene Count).
                        </li>
                        <li>From the Genes tab you can navigate within rows to specific PATRIC genome pages (Genome
                            Name), NCBI nucleotide pages for that genome (Accession), specific PATRIC locus pages (Locus
                            Tag), or a specific PATRIC Pathway Map page (Pathway Name).

            <h4 class="ribbon-title">Comparative Pathway Tool Information</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genome Count</strong>: This gives the number of genomes that have some genes present in this
                    pathway at the taxonomic level chosen.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unique Gene Count</strong>: This provides a list of all the genes in all the genomes that
                    belong to this pathway. Clicking on any number in this column will provide a list of the annotated
                    genes in each genome that belong to this family.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unique EC Count</strong>: The Enzyme Commission number (EC number) is a numerical
                    classification scheme for enzymes, based on the chemical reactions they catalyze and in a given KEGG
                    metabolic pathway, each step has an EC number assigned to it. In a given genome there may be several
                    genes that have been assigned the same EC number, meaning that several different genes have the
                    possibility of doing the same job. The unique EC count tells how many steps within the pathway have
                    at least one gene behind them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EC Conservation %</strong>: For a single pathway (row), this number gives the percent of
                    unique EC numbers present in all selected genomes. 100% describes a situation in which all unique EC
                    numbers are present in all selected genomes. Smaller numbers indicate that there is one or more
                    genomes are missing some EC numbers.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gene Conservation</strong>: A genome can have several genes that have been assigned the same
                    EC number. Gene conservation provides an estimate of pathways where there might be redundancies, or
                    where EC numbers are missing. Numbers greater than one mean that in at least one genome, there is
                    more than one gene that has been assigned a particular EC number. Numbers less than one mean
                    indicate that in at least one genome, a particular EC number is missing. This provides a quick way
                    to see which pathways have perfect conservation across all genomes (Gene Conservation = 1) to those
                    pathways where there are differences among the genomes. Users can then explore these differences by
                    drilling down on either the Unique Gene Count, or the Unique EC Count.
