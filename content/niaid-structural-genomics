        <p>The Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases apply state-of-the-art, high-throughput structural
            biology technologies to characterize the three dimensional (3-D) atomic structure of targeted proteins from
            pathogens in theNIAID priority lists. These targeted proteins are those with an important biological role or
            potential targets for vaccine and drug development.</p>
        <p>The Centers provide the research community with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="first">Experimental 3-D protein structures.</li>
            <li>Sequence-verified clones, and peptides made available through the centers. More will be added
                periodically.
            </li>
            <li>Scientific community requested 3-D structure determination.</li>
            <li class="last">Molecular screening of proteins in complex with inhibitors, cofactors and substrate
                analogs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The scientific community can make requests to the Centers to determine the structures of proteins of interest
            belonging to the targeted pathogens.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information about the structures solved or current
            targets, visit the individual Centers at:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>At&nbsp;PATRIC, you can see bacterial structures generated by the Centers, as well as make a request to the
            Centers for proteins at PATRIC that donâ€™t currently have a structure.</p>
