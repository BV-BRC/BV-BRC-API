		<p>The central data type in PATRIC is genomes.  Most of the data and information within PATRIC is related back to sequenced, assembled, and annotated genomes stored in the PATRIC database. Genomes are incorporated from RefSeq, GenBank, and other sources, and are annotated using a standard annotation protocol, RASTtk, to enable comparative analyses and linking of data across the website.</p>
